          <p>This was my capstone project. We built a web app that allows users to create, search for, and join other basketball players in their area and coordinate pick-up games. I was responsible for integrating Google Maps API and NYC parks API so that users had search-based map functionality to create and find games. Also created the form that allowed users to create and join games and stored the data in a Postgres database.</p>

          <p>This was my eCommerce project. We built an online bookstore that allows users to browse and search for books. They can then add books to their cart, and purchase them. I was responsible for the checkout process, making sure customers could input their address and payment information securely to checkout, and then receive a confirmation for their order. Users could then view their order history under their account information. I created all backend routes so that information was stored on the Postgres database.</p>

          <p>This was my 5-day hackathon project. Building off of the concept of an old MTV show combined with modern swipe-based dating, this application allows users to find restaurants more easily by removing the endless list of options. Users add a zip code they wish to eat in along with an optional cuisine type, and then are given one restaurant at a time. They can either NEXT the choice to be given another restaurant, or GO and be given location, reservation, and contact information from the restaurant.</p>
